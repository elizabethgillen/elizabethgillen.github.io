                        <p>On January 21st, 2018, I set off for London. I'd read every study abroad packing guide and advice blog out there,
                        and yet sitting alone on that plane, I didn't know what to expect. I had never been away from home for so long, and
                        the thought of navigating a big city all alone was as daunting as it was exciting. As much as those feelings were
                        confirmed when I touched down in London, I knew I had  made the right decision. </p> <br>
                        <p>Now, almost a year later, I know studying abroad in London was the single best decision I have ever made. I learned
                        how London worked and it soon became home. I traveled all across England, seeing Stone Henge, Bath, Canterbury, and Liverpool.
                        I even ventured outside the UK and visited Berlin, Dublin, Belfast, Paris, Lagos (Portugal), and Amsterdam. </p> <br>
                        <p>Balancing school work, friends, and travel proved difficult, but I left London a more independent, culturally aware
                        person than I was that scary day in January. I have made lasting memories and relationships, and I will carry those
                        experiences with me for the rest of my life. And somewhere, 3,000 miles away, I will always have a second home.

                        <!--<p>A shot from PSI's 2017 Christmas party</p> <br>-->
                        <p>From my very first semester at Arcadia, I've heard the same words of advice repeated countless times:
                        get an internship. Two years ago today, I was an intimidated Sophomore in college blindly attending career
                        fairs and doubting my likelihood of getting any position. Nonetheless, I went to the events I was told to go to,
                        and a couple months later when I emailed a few of the names on the business cards I had gotten, I had landed an
                        interview with Precision Systems, Inc, a local software engineering company. The next thing I knew, I was on my way
                        to my first day of work as an intern.</p> <br>
                        <p>Over a year later, I am still an intern at PSI, and I love my job. As a small company, the working environment is
                        close-knit and supportive. The engineers are kind and helpful, happy to serve as mentors and friends at the same time.
                        I have learned about so much more than I ever anticipated, and I never have to feel embarrassed about not knowing about
                        a particular subject because learning is stressed as a part of everyone's job, even the experienced senior engineers. I
                        am thankful that I heeded the advice I was given; internship experience is already proving invaluable, as I have been able
                        to explore several subareas of Computer Science that I would have otherwise never looked into. I look forward to my future
                        as a software engineer, taking with me everything I have learned as a student and intern. </p>
